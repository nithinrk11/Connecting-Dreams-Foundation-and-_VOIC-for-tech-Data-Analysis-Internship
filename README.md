- ðŸ”­ The 1st Project [(Sales Optimization Analysis)](https://github.com/nithinrk11/Connecting-Dreams-Foundation-and-_VOIC-for-tech-Data-Analysis-Internship/blob/main/Sales%20Optimization%20Analysis.pptx) Problem Statement was Optimizing the Superstore dataset in its business operations by understanding sales patterns, profitability across different regions, categories, and customer segment performance to make data-driven decisions for improving business efficiency and profitability. The expected End Users are Store Managers and Administrators, Sales Team, Marketing Department, Business Strategists, and Category Managers. The Analysis found that Technology is the highest-performing category with sales of $836,154, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies Consumer Customer Segment leads in sales ($1,161,401), representing about 50% of total sales. There's a negative correlation between discounts and profits, suggesting a careful discount strategy is needed The overall profit margin of 12.47% indicates room for improvement in operational efficiency.


- ðŸ”­ The 2nd Project   [(Healthcare Utilization Analysis)](https://github.com/nithinrk11/Connecting-Dreams-Foundation-and-_VOIC-for-tech-Data-Analysis-Internship/blob/main/Healthcare%20Utilization%20Analysis.pptx) Problem Statement was to Understanding Healthcare Utilization: Analyze the factors influencing the number of doctor visits, such as age, income, and health status. Gender Disparities: Investigate if there are any significant differences in healthcare utilization between genders. Impact of Socioeconomic Status: Examine how income and access to private health insurance affect healthcare utilization. The expected End Users are Healthcare Providers, Policy Makers, and Researchers. The analysis highlights that health status and illness levels are significant factors influencing healthcare utilization, while age and income are not strong predictors. Gender differences exist, with females utilizing healthcare services more than males. Socioeconomic factors like private insurance have a modest impact on healthcare utilization. These insights can guide healthcare providers and policymakers in designing targeted interventions to improve healthcare access and efficiency. Further research could explore additional variables or external factors influencing healthcare utilization.

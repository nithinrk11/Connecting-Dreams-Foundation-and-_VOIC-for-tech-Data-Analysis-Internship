# Healthcare Utilization Analysis

**Analyzing Trends in Doctor-Patient Visits, Gender Dynamics, and Insurance Patterns**

## Overview
This project explores healthcare utilization patterns focusing on the relationships between doctor visits, socioeconomic factors, and insurance coverage.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze the factors influencing the number of doctor visits (e.g., age, income, health status).
- Investigate gender disparities in healthcare utilization.
- Examine the impact of income and access to private health insurance on healthcare utilization.

## Problem Statement
Understanding the factors driving healthcare utilization is essential for optimizing resource allocation, addressing disparities, and designing targeted interventions. This project seeks to uncover these trends and provide actionable insights.

## Project Description
The dataset includes variables such as:
- **Age**
- **Income**
- **Insurance status** (private, government-provided, old-age government insurance)
- **Gender**
- **Chronic health conditions**

Key analyses:
1. Evaluate the influence of insurance types on healthcare visits.
2. Assess the impact of income levels.
3. Examine demographic factors like gender and their correlations with healthcare visits.

**Insights provided can guide**:
- Policy decisions.
- Resource allocation.
- Strategies for improving healthcare access and effectiveness.

## End Users
- **Healthcare Providers**: Optimize resource allocation and improve patient care strategies.
- **Policy Makers**: Design policies addressing disparities in healthcare access.
- **Researchers**: Study the socioeconomic factors influencing healthcare utilization.

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **IDE**: Google Colab

## Results

### Healthcare Utilization and Gender Analysis
- **Age vs. Doctor Visits**: Weak correlation (0.125), indicating age is not a strong predictor.
- **Health Status**: Poorer health correlates with more visits.
- **Chronic Conditions**: Surprisingly, patients without chronic conditions tend to visit more often.
- **Gender Disparities**: Females have a higher average number of visits than males.

### Socioeconomic Status
- Majority of patients are not reliant on insurance.
- Private insurance is the preferred option among insured patients.
- Weak negative correlation between income and doctor visits (-0.077).
- Insurance appears to have a limited impact on the frequency of visits.

## Conclusion
- **Significant Factors**: Health status and illness levels strongly influence healthcare utilization.
- **Modest Factors**: Gender differences and private insurance have a noticeable but modest impact.
- **Weak Factors**: Age and income are not strong predictors.

These insights can help design targeted interventions to improve healthcare access and efficiency. Future work could explore additional variables or external factors.
